### Death Sequence - Kennedy

When the player dies, a window will pop up letting the user know that they have lost the game. They will also be prompted with two options: A button to restart the game and a button to quit the game. For future additions, I would like to add customized death images that will be displayed based on what character the player is playing as. I would also like to customize the UI more.
