### Fleeing from battle - Brendan
Battle fleeing was implemented using a button below Attack labeled "Flee" in `FrmBattle.cs`. Once clicked, this button chooses between two options: closing the window as if the fight has ended (successful flee), or allowing the enemy to attack the player (failed flee). The success chance of fleeing is set at 50%. Changes confined to `FrmBattle.cs` and `FrmBattle.Designer.cs`.
